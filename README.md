# Spectral co-Clustering in Multi-layer Stochastic co-Block Models
This repository contains the main functions to run simulations and analysis for the paper "Spectral co-Clustering in Rank-deﬁcient Multi-layer Stochastic co-Block Models" by Wenqing Su et al.

# Python Code
The file [simulation.ipynb](simulation.ipynb) contains an example of DSoG for co-clustering in multi-layer ScBMs. The file [real data analysis.ipynb](real data analysis.ipynb) contains an real-world application of the DSoG method to the Worldwide Food and Agricultural Trade dataset. The raw data used in this article can be found at [https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TM](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TM). It can be transformed to a multi-layer network, where layers represent food and agricultural products, and nodes are countries and edges at each layer represent import/export relationships of a speciﬁc food and agricultural product among countries.
Researchers interested in the preprocessed correlation matrices themselves directly can contact Kevin Z. Lin.
